# About this repository

This repository contains code examples that supplements material in the Nvidia-DLI course titled "Scaling Cuda C/C++ Applications to Multiple Nodes".

Please navigate to the appropriate directory to see the code sample, compilation instructions, how to run etc. You will also find a README.md file in each directory that will provide more information about the code sample.

In addition, the following two repositories are a good reference to know more about the multi-gpu programming model and Cuda programming in general.

1. [Multi-GPU Programming Model](https://github.com/NVIDIA/multi-gpu-programming-models)

2. [CUDA Samples](https://github.com/NVIDIA-developer-blog/code-samples/tree/master)

# Table of Contents
